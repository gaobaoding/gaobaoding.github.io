Recently, Ning Gao joined Google as a Machine Learning Engineer. Before that, Ning obtained his PhD degree in Autonomous Learning Robots (ALR) at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php) (KIT) supervised by [Prof. Gerhard Neumann](https://alr.anthropomatik.kit.edu/21_65.php). He was a doctoral researcher at [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)](https://www.bosch-ai.com/), Renningen, Germany. His research interests lie in the field of large language model, meta‑learning and self‑supervised learning towards efficient and generalizable representation on novel tasks across various robotic applications, e.g. natural language processing, robotic
grasping, 6D object pose estimation, object segmentation and scene understanding.
